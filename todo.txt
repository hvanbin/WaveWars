(A) Add a pause button with esc, which should show a menu of resuming, instructions, or quitting
(B) Fix the trail system so that the trails are contiguous from the previous position to the new position, so they are more like trails, before they fade
(C) Add a visual queue system to the bottom of the screen to show the next waves selected to be spawned. This may entail many changes.
x Fix the draw order of the grid, shields, waves, and spawn buttons in that order, so buttons are rendered on top
x Move the spawn points to always be atop the spawn buttons
x Make the spawn buttons appear as slightly smaller waves, much like the trails are now
x Switch the movement direction of the player and AI waves because the spawn direction was previously fixed
x Add some trails or other visual effects to make the waves look more like waves and less like squares
x Add a key press to switch the type of wave to spawn (using WASD)
x Fix the spawner column -- it should be behind the column of shields
x Make the spawner column match the color of the currently selected wave
x Make the grid size configurable in a TOML file
x Make the number of shield columns configurable in a TOML file
x Make waves "slide past" each other (not collide) when they do not end on the same tile
x Have explosions resulting from the collision disappear after one turn/cycle
x Have shields be destroyed when they are collided with (they should have the same explosion)
x Have the AI player shoot waves from the right-side instead of the left. The player's waves should go from the left to the right.
x When one wave makes it past the shields, the proper win banner should show
x Expand the grid to 20x20 to allow for more strategic and slower play
